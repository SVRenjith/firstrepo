Get Your External IP Address
The most common way of finding out your public IP address (the one that we’re provided by our ISP) by visiting a site such as What Is My IP or even typing “what is my IP address” into Google.
We can actually use the Terminal to discover our public IP address using a similar service as above called IP Echo.
